                    <p class="lead"> I designed this device with the intention of testing my mechatronics capabilities. Upon entering the University of Waterloo for mechatronics, I was always told "by the end of this degree, you will have the skills required to build
                        a robot". This sounded really cool to me, and unlike many of my classmates I had no clue where to start with something like this. This project, designed in my third year, was a culmination of many of the skills I have been gradually
                        developing.

                                <p>The first prototype was designed for simplicity - a flat plate with attachments for the motors. This would allow me to get a feel for the space required for the electronics and spacing of the propellers. After running the
                                    motors, it was clear that there was an issue - one of the motors would not run. There was an audible beep as if it was powered, but when it was signalled it did not respond. Using a multimeter I tested the voltage to
                                    the ESC, current from the Arduino, and current to the motor. From this, it was clear that one of the ESCs was broken. <br> <br> I removed the cover from the ESC and checked the board for damage, but found none. The
                                    connections between components on the board seemed to check out, but with no response, I requested a replacement.

                                    <h3>Assembly</h3>
                                    <p>The final design was then created in Solidworks, with an aim to be easy to 3D print and assemble. The enclosure was entirely 3D printed and uses screws and nuts that I had from a previous project for attaching the top
                                        and bottom together. <br> <br> In CAD, all of the internal components fit compactly within the body, however during assembly it was clear I overlooked on crucial part - the wires themselves. Dupont wires commonly
                                        used for arduino projects stick up very high from the board, and end up taking a lot of space. This meant I had to shift the battery off center to fit everything within the build. While the final prototype looked
                                        good from the outside, the center of gravity was shifted. It is later revealed through testing that this would not allow the drone to take off.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Testing</h3>
                                    <p>I ran the test several times, adjusting the internal layout of components between tests. The motors were set to gradually increase in rpm, and slow down once the LiDAR detected that it was off the ground. Since the
                                        weight was not centered, the motors were not able to adjust the tilt of the quadcopter based on the gyroscope readings, and thus the quadcopter tipped over.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Future Improvements</h3>
                                    <p>I am working on redesigning the enclosure to have a larger capacity and defined mounting for the internal components. I will ensure that the CG is centered in CAD prior to assembly and retest the prototype.
                                    </p>
