                <div class="col-twelve">
                    <p class="lead"> The design of Mars rovers has evolved significantly since the first missions, with a focus on enhancing mobility and durability in the harsh Martian environment. Central to this evolution is the rocker-bogie drivetrain, a suspension
                        system that provides superior terrain adaptability and stability over uneven surfaces.

                        <p>The rocker-bogie configuration consists of linked rockers and bogies, allowing the rover to maintain contact with the ground while navigating obstacles. The joints within this drivetrain are critical for enabling movement and articulation,
                            facilitating the rover's ability to traverse rocky and varied terrains. As missions advance, optimizing these joints is essential for improving the rover's overall performance and longevity.

                <h5>Strategy</h5>
                <h1>Research</h1>

                <p class="lead">Understanding the dynamics of rocker-bogie drivetrains is crucial for enhancing rover mobility. Key failure modes include joint fatigue, excessive deflection, and material degradation due to environmental factors. Analyzing stress concentrations
                    and load distributions is essential in predicting potential joint failures.

            <p class="lead">Various material properties, such as tensile strength and fatigue limits, must be considered during the design process. Additionally, the interaction between the rocker-bogie segments impacts the overall performance; ensuring that the joints
                can accommodate these dynamic loads is vital for successful operation.</p>

                    <h1>Conceptual Design</h1>

                    <p class="lead">My concept design employs welded aluminum tubing interfacing with carbon fiber tubing, utilizing bushings to facilitate rotation between the inner and outer components. This innovative approach aims to balance strength and weight reduction
                        while maintaining optimal functionality within the drivetrain.

                        <h3>Material Selection</h3>

                        <p>The materials considered for the joint design include Aluminum and Steel.
                            <br>
                            <p>The table to the right summarizes the differences between these materials. Aluminum was ultimately selected due to its light weight and corrosion resistance. Stainless steel was also an option, but is more difficult to fabricate
                                and too heavy for this application.</p>

                            <p> At the time of writing this, the image to the right is the only sketches I have an image of. There were many, many iterations of the stack-up. Ease of assembly and long-term deterioration were the main considerations during
                                this process.

                        <p class="lead">The redesign achieved a 32% reduction in weight compared to the previous joint design and decreased the component count by 45%. By optimizing the lengths of the rocker-bogie segments—an effort supported by my partner's MATLAB analysis—I
                            improved the rover’s overall dynamics. The joint was meticulously modeled in SolidWorks, and finite element analysis (FEA) was conducted on critical parts based on the load cases identified in the research phase, ensuring that
                            the design could withstand the harsh conditions of Mars.

                            <p>This project emphasized the importance of system-level thinking during the conceptual design phase in mechanical engineering, particularly regarding manufacturing and assembly. By anticipating manufacturing challenges, I was
                                able to develop a solution that minimized both complexity and weight. I also recognized that thorough research and an understanding of failure modes are essential for creating robust designs. Moving forward, I will apply
                                these lessons to future projects, focusing on balancing innovation with practical constraints to ensure that designs are not only effective but also manufacturable and reliable.
